## Test App for Kontador

### Brief

Develop a JavaScript web application that fetches a relevantly-sized list of posts from the mock [GraphQL API](https://fakerql.stephix.uk/) and displays a histogram representing the number of posts created in each month of 2019.

---

### Info

- The application must be built using React, how you scaffold it is up to you
- We use Apollo for GraphQL API communication, but you can use a different solution if you feel it is better suited
- The histogram must be constructed using D3 or VX (recommended)
- Use Git for version control and to commit any progress you make
- Write a brief summary in your README about your process, your choices and any challenges you faced
- Please do not spend more than 4 hours on development for this task, just submit your progress at the end of that time
